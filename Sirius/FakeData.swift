      description: "This cat breed is one of the oldest. The Ethiopian Beast (it’s also called) is a cat of rare intelligence and stubbornness. The breed is famous for its exclusive colors – wild, red (sorrel or cinnamon), blue and fawn are common to the Abyssinian. Ideally, each hair of her coat has a triple ticking. Pictures of these cats’ – descendants of Zula, the first Abyssinian, brought to Europe – don’t convey all the wild charm of the breed."

      description: "The history of the Bengal breed has a happy ending. Bangkok purrs were on the verge of extinction. One of these unfortunates was taken to America by geneticist Jean Mill. The cat was named Malaysia. She liked America, though she didn’t show it off. She demonstrated aggressive disposition in any possible way. Only during heat she let the neighbor’s black cat get close to her. The product of their love became a Bengal kitten itself. The description of Bengals is similar to the jaguar’s – the same predatory coloring, the same wild disposition."

      description: "The Australian smoky cat is the breed that can boldly be called unique. Born in the homeland of the kangaroo, in Australia, the Australian Mist took the best from its closest relatives – the Abyssinian cat, the Burmesian cat and from simple non-breed cats. The best thing, first of all, is expressed in color. It is a spotted coat or a marbled-spotted coat with a general tickd tabby background. Outside of Australia this breed practically can’t be found."

      description: "Cats dressed in “wire coats” differ from American short-haired cats (about them – below) not even in the quality of the coat, but in its appearance. \n\n Being soft to the touch, it seems prickly in appearance and creates the illusion of a wire. Often the wire effect is not expressed throughout the pelt, but is concentrated along the backbone and tail."

    Cat(
      name: "Walking cat",
      imageName: "walking_cat",
      description: "All cat breeds have a history. Some breeds have a short history and are usually artificially bred, while others have a history stretching back several centuries. Such as the American Bobtail. These animals were called not yet cats, but domesticated lynxes. Indeed, if you look at pictures of the American short-tailed Bobtail, you’ll clearly see something lynx-like in it!"

      description: "Representatives of this breed led a rather tempestuous life in the Armenian Highlands, on the territory around Lake Van in ancient times. Therefore, their genotype is closest to the “wild type”. It can be seen (among other things) in the fact that cats of this breed do not meow at all, imitating their wild counterparts. They make “bird” noises, which is why Anatolics are also called “chirping” cats."
